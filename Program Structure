Below, feel free to edit how you think the design of the program should go.

I have begun to design which classes will have to be created, but since the design isn't complete yet, none of this is set in stone.


Autonomous:


Teleop:


Classes/Libraries used and implemented in Autonomous mode ( created by us to make life easier when initializing everything in main program ):
  -Ultrasonic/Distance sensor
  -Color sensor
  -( Possible, not set in stone ) Touch sensor
