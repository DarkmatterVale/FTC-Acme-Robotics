Below add TO-DOs for the Autonomous program:

MainAutonomous ( Parking Zone Start ):
    1. Initialize Robot
    2. Find IR beacon
        Distance ( Wherever we need to be )
        Direction ( center )
    3. Use manipulator to put ball in center tube ( program it in because of the possiblity catapult will not make it in )
    4. ( Secondary Objective, programmed last ) Move ball "holders" to designated area to gain additional points
    5. Move to location we want to go to after autonomous
    6. ***IMPORTANT***: we need to add support for compass sensor to determine direction
    
MainAutonomous ( Ramp Start ):
    1. Initialize Robot
    2. Drive down ramp
    3. Use manipulator to put ball in closest tube
    4. Move tube(s) to parking zone
